Project repo for the WEB design technology discipline with website development which includes authentication and anti-fraud features.

The task is creating a business card website which supports authentication with 3-ty resources and an anti-fraud feature.

My student number is 12 so I will create the website with authentication via Google and registration via WhatsApp.
The website will also include the DDOS protection feature.

Will be used a PHP for website creation. MySQL as a database and XAMPP for testing and development.
